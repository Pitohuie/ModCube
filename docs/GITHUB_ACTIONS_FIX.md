# GitHub Actions Bundle Error Fix

## Problem Description

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.7/x64/bin/bundle' failed with exit code 16
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **platform mismatch** in the `Gemfile.lock` file:

- The `Gemfile.lock` was generated on Windows (`x64-mingw32` platform)
- GitHub Actions runs on Ubuntu Linux (`x86_64-linux` platform)
- Bundle couldn't resolve dependencies for the Linux platform

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Gemfile.lock for Multi-Platform Support

Added Linux platform support to the existing `Gemfile.lock`:

```bash
cd docs
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
```

This command:
- Keeps existing Windows platform gems
- Adds Linux-compatible gem versions
- Ensures the lockfile works on both platforms

### 2. Verified Platform Support

The `Gemfile.lock` now includes both platforms:
```
PLATFORMS
  x64-mingw32
  x86_64-linux
```

## Prevention

### For Future Development

1. **When adding new gems**, run the platform update command:
   ```bash
   bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
   ```

2. **Before pushing changes**, verify the Gemfile.lock includes both platforms

3. **Consider using a .gitignore approach** (alternative solution):
   - Add `Gemfile.lock` to `.gitignore`
   - Let GitHub Actions generate its own lockfile
   - Trade-off: Less reproducible builds

### Alternative Solutions

If the problem persists, consider these approaches:

1. **Remove platform-specific gems** from Gemfile.lock:
   ```bash
   bundle lock --remove-platform x64-mingw32
   bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
   ```

2. **Use Docker** for consistent environments:
   ```yaml
   - name: Build with Jekyll
     run: |
       docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
         jekyll/jekyll:4.3 jekyll build
   ```

3. **Update Ruby version** in GitHub Actions:
   ```yaml
   ruby-version: '3.2'  # or latest stable
   ```

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. **Push changes** to trigger GitHub Actions
2. **Check Actions tab** for successful build
3. **Monitor deployment** to GitHub Pages
